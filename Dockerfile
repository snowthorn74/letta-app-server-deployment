# python3: required at runtime for skills (e.g. Discord)
# curl/wget: common in tool and skill examples for fetching remote assets/APIs
# jq: common in API/debug examples for inspecting JSON responses
# nodejs: required by the installed letta CLI entrypoint
# npm: fallback package manager for channel runtime installs and remote shell use.
# It is installed with Bun below instead of Debian's npm package to avoid
# pulling a large extra dependency tree into the runtime image.

# installs while still shipping npm as a compatibility fallback.

# Railway services connected to this repo can then auto-deploy from Git commits
